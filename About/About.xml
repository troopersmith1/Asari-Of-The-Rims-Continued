	<description>A long time ago, when humanity began to spread across the stars, genetic engineering was used to create a species which was before only seen in games. The Asari! 
It is lost to history what exactly happened and how the Asari Union came to be, but now, thousands of years later, the Asari are just as wide spread in the galaxy as humanity. 

Features:
- New, fully playable race: The Asari from the ME Universe! They work just like normal humans! 
- They come in 4 different colours: Blue, Violet, Light Blue and Green! 
- Each skin color has multiple different head versions! 
- They bleed purple, not red! 
- Custom life stages! Just like the real ones! 
- Custom names! Yes! They all have names like the asari in ME! 
- They live up to 1000 years! 
- They work like a vanilla faction! They send visitors and traders and maybe even attack you!
- CE Compatible!
